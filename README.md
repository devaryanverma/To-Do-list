In our day to day busy life we generally forgets our little tasks so
to make this easier, I have made an app which uses React Native
and JavaScript. This app is very easy to use as it have very
simple UI so that a new smartphone user or someone who don't
know how to use smartphone can also use this app. You just
simply have to click on the add item button and you can simply
add the item in your To-Do list. If you wish to delete the item from
your list you just need to tap on that item. As I have used the
React Native to make this app so it can work on both platforms
Android and IOS.
